## FAQs:
### Why use Archlinux as base and not Debian or Gentoo ?
Debian is stable but most of our developers are from the arch community and hence we prefer a rolling release model, and hence prefer faster updates.
Gentoo ? way too complex and not everyone can afford that compliation time. Our end-user focus is on providing a stable environment and let users enjoy more of the arch-ecosystem without the pain of configuring from scratch, allowing more time and energy to be spent on work and studies.

### **History**
This project was founded by `wiz64, natimerry and pixel furry`, as a personal project. The name `JimniOS` comes from the hindi word `Jamuni` which represents the purple/violet/pinkish color of *Syzygium cumini* (Jamun), representing the theme and color of the Linux Distribution.
